                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>125 g unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>100 g light brown sugar</li>
                    <li>75 g white granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 medium egg</li>
                    <li>1 tsp vanilla (optional!)</li>
                    <li>300 g plain flour</li>
                    <li>1 + 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
                    <li>300 g chocolate chips (150g dark, 150g milk)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="method">
                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add your butter and sugars to a bowl and beat until creamy - I use my stand mixer with the beater attachment!</l>
                    <li>Add in your egg, and beat again. If using vanilla, add it in now!</l>
                    <li>Add in the plain flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt and beat until a cookie dough is formed!</l>
                    <li>Add in your chocolate chips and beat till they're distributed well!</l>
                    <li>Weigh your cookies out into eight cookie dough balls - they're about 120g each!</l>
                    <li>Once they're rolled into balls, put your cookie dough in the freezer for at least 30 minutes, or in the fridge for an hour or so!</l>
                    <li>Whilst the cookie dough is chilling, preheat your oven to 180C Fan, or 200C regular! If your oven runs hot, go for 160C-170c.</l>
                    <li>Take your cookies out of the freezer/fridge and put onto a lined baking tray. I put four cookies per tray!</l>
                    <li>Bake the cookies in the oven for 12-14 minutes. I don't personally flatten the cookies, as they flatten enough during baking - however, if you like flat cookies, flatten them a bit before baking.</l>
                    <li>Once baked, leave them to cool on the tray for at least 30 minutes, as they will continue to bake whilst cooling!</l>
                    <li>ENJOY!
                </ol>
